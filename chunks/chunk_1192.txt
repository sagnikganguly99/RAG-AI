The Card Advantage
Credit cards are a good source of short-term credit 
without having to pay any interest (if paid within 
the allowed grace period). In return, you can earn 
several reward points, facilities and other benefits like 
discounts on dining out, travel and show tickets as 
well as lifestyle products. 
However, the customer should always keep close 
track of his billing cycle and pay the entire sum of 
money due within the allowed grace period. The 
maximum number of interest-free days can be availed 
if the user plans and times his purchases at the starting 
of the card’s billing cycle. The maximum utilization 
of the grace period can be achieved by using more 
than one card and timing the purchase according to 
the respective billing cycles.
