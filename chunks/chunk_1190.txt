paying a huge amount as interest charges. 
For this category of customers, the most significant 
factor is the interest rate. They would prefer cards 
offering a less interest rate even if the other rewards 
and benefits are less. So, the highest weightage in 
their case is given to interest rate charged and less 
weightage to rewards and other card-linked benefits. 
For joining fee and annual fee, the weights remain the 
same as in the other category.
Weightage to various parameters is assigned in 
this order: interest rate: 40 per cent; annual fee: 15 
per cent; joining fee: 10 per cent; reward points: 20 
per cent; benefits: 15 per cent. These variables are 
then scaled down to 70 per cent assigned weightage 
for product and 30 per cent assigned weightage for 
customer service/satisfaction. 
For this category of customers we recommend 
PNB Gold Card as best buy and UBI Gold Card and 
Axis My Choice as good buys.
